2. Customer Management: Store customer details. For each customer, we need to store their full name, email address and phone number. Bookworm’s Haven also allows customers to sign up for their membership and become a Chapter Chaser allowing them to collect points with every purchase. We need to know if the customer is a Chapter Chaser or not.
